# Music File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the background music file. 

To add background music:
1. Add your romantic music file as `music.mp3` in the `/public` folder
2. Recommended: A soft, romantic instrumental piece (2-3 minutes)
3. Keep file size reasonable for web loading (under 5MB)

Suggested romantic music styles:
- Soft piano melodies
- Acoustic guitar instrumentals
- Light orchestral pieces
- Lo-fi romantic beats

Note: Due to browser autoplay policies, users will need to interact with the music controls to start playback.
